## Algorithms

### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a statistical model that is widely used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using a logistic function. The algorithm finds the best-fitting model to describe the relationship between the binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

### Single Layer Perceptron
The Single Layer Perceptron is a simple type of artificial neural network used for binary classification. It consists of a single layer of output nodes connected to input nodes, where the output is a weighted sum of inputs passed through an activation function. This algorithm is foundational in understanding more complex neural networks.

### Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)
The Multi Layer Perceptron is a class of feedforward artificial neural networks. It consists of multiple layers of nodes, typically including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, except for the input nodes, is a neuron that uses a non-linear activation function. MLPs are widely used for both classification and regression tasks.

### Hopfield Network
A Hopfield Network is a recurrent neural network with binary threshold nodes. It serves as an associative memory system with binary states. Hopfield networks are used for pattern recognition and storage, where the network is able to recall stored patterns from partial or noisy input patterns.

### Kohonen Network (Self-Organizing Map)
The Kohonen Network, also known as a Self-Organizing Map (SOM), is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering and visualization of high-dimensional data. It maps multi-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional grid, preserving the topological properties of the input data. SOMs are particularly useful for tasks like data compression and pattern recognition.

### Genetic Algorithm
A Genetic Algorithm is a search heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection. It is used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover, and selection. Genetic Algorithms are widely applied in fields such as engineering, economics, and artificial intelligence.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K-Nearest Neighbors is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. It operates by finding the `k` closest data points in the feature space and assigning labels based on majority voting (for classification) or averaging (for regression). KNN is particularly effective for small datasets with fewer features.
